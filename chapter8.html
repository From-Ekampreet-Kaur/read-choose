      The knife. The photo. The red moon.<br><br>
      Ishaan had proof now.  
      But what use was the truth when the world was blind to it?<br><br>
      He needed answers. He needed to know who had rewritten reality itself.  
      So he started digging.<br><br>
      Through records. Through silence. Through lies.  
      A janitor. A whisper. A locked door beneath the science block.  
      <br><br>
      <em>"The archive,"</em> they said.  
      <em>"No one goes down there anymore."</em><br><br>
      So Ishaan went.

          The walls were marked in chalk — symbols like the ones from the red moon journal.  
          <br><br>
          Filing cabinets lined the halls. Each drawer marked with numbers, not names.  
          In one drawer: <strong class="glow">Case 0997 - Memory Severance Subjects: Arjun M. / Kabir K.</strong>  
          <br><br>
          His hands shook as he opened it. Inside — pages of psychological breakdowns, behavioral control, timelines.  
          <em>“Subjects uncooperative. Initiate full wipe. Disassociate from Host: I. Kapoor.”</em>  
          <br><br>
          They were testing on him.

          “What... I am?”

          Audio logs from a room marked ‘Red Watch Lab’.

          One entry chilled Ishaan to the bone:

          <em>“Subject I.K. displays retroactive guilt loops. Dreams bleed into reality. Memory reshapes events. Recommend: containment or deletion.”</em>  
          <br><br>
          And at the bottom: a photo of him.  
          Eyes blank. Hooked to wires.  
          <br><br>
          Labeled: <strong class="glow">THE FINDER</strong>.
