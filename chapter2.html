    <h2>Chapter 2: The Body in the Hall</h2>
    <p>
      Ishaan opened the door slowly, half-expecting no one to be there.  
      But the hallway wasn’t empty.  
      At the far end, under the flickering dorm light, lay a shape—unmoving.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stepped out, heart pounding in his ears.  
      The silence pressed down like a physical weight. As he approached, he recognized the figure.  
      It was Arjun—sprawled on the floor, face pale, lips parted. A small pool of blood was already forming beneath his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the wall beside Arjun, written in something dark and smeared, were four chilling words:  
      <strong>“You were too late.”</strong>
    </p>
    <p><strong>What should Ishaan do now?</strong></p>

    <div class="choices">
      <button onclick="showScene('scene2a')">Run to alert the warden</button>
      <button onclick="showScene('scene2b')">Check Arjun’s pulse</button>
      <button onclick="showScene('scene2c')">Take a photo of the wall</button>

  <!-- Scene 2A -->
  <div id="scene2a" class="scene">
    <h2>Chapter 2A: The Panic</h2>
    <p>
      Ishaan opened the door slowly. A shape lay under the flickering dorm light.  
      It was Arjun—pale, blood pooling under his head.  
      On the wall: <strong>“You were too late.”</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Ishaan turned and sprinted down the hallway. Each step echoed louder than the last.  
      The warden’s room was dark. He banged the door, gasping, “Help! Someone’s hurt!”  
      Lights flicked on. Faces appeared.  
      Minutes later, the hallway filled with voices and sirens.  
      The last thing he saw before being sent back was Kabir, standing still, staring at the message—expression unreadable.

  <!-- Scene 2B -->
  <div id="scene2b" class="scene">
    <h2>Chapter 2B: The Final Breath</h2>
    <p>
      Ishaan opened the door slowly. A shape lay under the flickering dorm light.  
      It was Arjun—pale, blood pooling under his head.  
      On the wall: <strong>“You were too late.”</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      He dropped to his knees and pressed fingers to Arjun’s neck—cold, but still a faint pulse.  
      “Arjun?”  
      The boy's lips moved. Blood trickled down his cheek.  
      “It... wasn’t him…”  
      Then silence. No breath.  
      Ishaan backed away, chilled to his core. Who wasn’t “him”? Not Kabir?  
      Behind him, a floorboard creaked.

  <!-- Scene 2C -->
  <div id="scene2c" class="scene">
    <h2>Chapter 2C: The Evidence</h2>
    <p>
      Ishaan opened the door slowly. A shape lay under the flickering dorm light.  
      It was Arjun—pale, blood pooling under his head.  
      On the wall: <strong>“You were too late.”</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised his phone and took a photo of the wall, then Arjun.  
      The blood. The message. The silence.  
      As he zoomed in, he noticed a smear—maybe a fingerprint?  
      Something slipped from Arjun’s hand.  
      A folded note, soaked in blood.  
      He opened it just enough to see four words:  
      <strong>"I saw the knife."</strong>  
      A door creaked behind him.
