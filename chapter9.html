      Ishaan couldn’t sleep. Couldn’t eat. Couldn’t breathe without feeling like the walls were listening.  
      <br><br>
      The photo. The knife. The records.  
      They proved everything — and yet, *everyone* looked through him.  
      <br><br>
      His professors smiled with pity. His classmates whispered like he’d gone mad.  
      And the shadows… the shadows moved when he wasn’t looking.  
      <br><br>
      He stopped attending classes. Stopped answering calls. He began drawing the symbols.  
      On his walls. On his skin.  
      <br><br>
      “They’re watching,” he murmured. “They want me to forget too.”  
      <br>
      But he wouldn’t. He *couldn’t*.
