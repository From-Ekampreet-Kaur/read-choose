    <h2>Chapter 1: The Red Moon Rises</h2>
    <p>
      Devgarh had always been a quiet town, but tonight was different.  
      The air was too still, the streets too silent—as if the town itself was holding its breath.  
      The sky bled red. The moon, enormous and ominous, loomed over the horizon like an eye that never blinked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside Dorm 3C, Ishaan Kapoor sat at the edge of his bed, staring through the window.  
      The red glow of the moon painted his walls in streaks of blood.  
      Something felt wrong—not just eerie, but deeply personal.  
      A weight pressed against his chest like a forgotten memory crawling back.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought about Arjun, his childhood friend, distant lately. And Kabir, unpredictable, quiet.  
      There was tension between them lately—something unspoken, something dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      A loud knock broke the silence. It came from the hallway outside his door.
    </p>
    <p><strong>What should Ishaan do?</strong></p>
