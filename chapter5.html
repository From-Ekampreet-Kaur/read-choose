    <p id="text">
      Kabir’s words haunted him.  
      <em>“I didn’t kill him… but I know who did.”</em>  
      <br><br>
      But now Kabir lay unconscious in the hospital. No visitors allowed. No explanations given.  
      Ishaan’s mind spun as he plugged the flash drive into his laptop.  
      <br><br>
      A folder popped open.  
      <strong>“FinalProject_Truth”</strong>  
      Inside—videos. Audio clips. Screenshots. Edited photos.  
      <br><br>
      Arjun’s voice crackled through:  
      <em>“Ishaan’s memory is breaking. He doesn’t remember what we did in the woods last year. But I do.”</em>  
      <br><br>
      Ishaan’s heart thundered. What did he mean?  
      A blurred image loaded next—three boys, hands bloodied, digging.  
      <br><br>
      Names flickered in his head. Places. Moments.  
      Things he knew... or thought he did.  
      <br><br>
      Then a file named: <strong>“FindHer_Final”</strong>  
      It was a video. Static. Then a girl’s face. Crying. Screaming.  
      <br><br>
      Suddenly it hit him like a train:  
      <em>They had covered something up. Someone. Some night. And he had forgotten.</em>  
      <br><br>
      His reflection in the screen stared back, foreign.  
      And then… the knock on the door.
