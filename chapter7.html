      The world was still.  
      Ishaan stood in the middle of the campus courtyard, surrounded by people he’d known for years.  
      But they looked at him like he was a stranger.  
      <br><br>
      “Kabir?” he asked.  
      A pause. A few confused glances.  
      “Who?” someone whispered.  
      <br><br>
      “Arjun,” he tried. “The boy who died.”  
      A girl tilted her head. “I think you need help.”  
      <br><br>
      His chest tightened. He ran to the admin office.  
      Files — gone. No “Kabir Kapoor.” No “Arjun Mishra.”  
      Yearbook photos — blank. Their faces replaced by static.  
      <br><br>
      He found their dorm room. Bedsheets tucked perfectly. Two untouched beds. As if no one had ever slept there.  
      <em>“I’m losing my mind,”</em> Ishaan whispered.

          Ishaan flipped open his journal.  
          In the back pocket, a photo fluttered out.  
          Three boys. One camera. One summer.  
          <br><br>
          Arjun. Kabir. Ishaan.  
          <br>
          Their arms were locked, faces sweaty with laughter.  
          <br><br>
          He turned it over.  
          In Arjun’s handwriting: <em>“To our last real day.”</em>

          The woods welcomed him with silence.  
          He followed his memory — the broken chapel path, the trail of ash.

          Under a twisted pine, he dug with bare hands.  
          <br>
          The soil bled red.  
          <br><br>
          He found it. The knife. Arjun’s name carved into the handle. Blood still dried at the base.  
          <br><br>
          His hands trembled.  
          He hadn’t imagined it.

          “Kabir?” she asked. “Arjun?”

          He wasn’t safe. He was trapped.  
          And someone… was watching.
