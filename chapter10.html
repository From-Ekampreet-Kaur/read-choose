    <h2>Chapter 10: The Return of the Red Moon</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="fade">
        <em>Seven years later.</em><br><br>
        The world had moved on.<br>
        Devgarh was no longer whispered about in newspapers or rumors.<br>
        Arjun? Kabir? No records. No photos. No police files.  
        Just forgotten shadows of a story no one remembered living.<br><br>
      </span>

      But that night — <span class="bold">the red moon returned</span>.<br>
      Hung again over the town like a curse breaking free.<br><br>

      At 11:27 PM, a video went viral.  
      Grainy footage of a hidden chamber beneath the old campus.  
      <em>Bloodstains. Symbols. Files marked with names that weren’t supposed to exist.</em><br><br>

      People gasped. Authorities denied. But the damage was done.  
      For the first time, the world started asking questions.<br><br>

      And in a high-security psychiatric unit outside Delhi...  
      Ishaan Kapoor watched the red moon rise from behind shatterproof glass.<br><br>

      He didn’t scream. He didn’t cry.<br>
      He just whispered: <span class="whisper">“They remember now.”</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      That night, under the cover of chaos, fire alarms, and forgotten keys —  
      Ishaan escaped.<br><br>
      He ran. Limping, broken, hallucinating. But guided by purpose.<br><br>

      The address had come from someone anonymous. A file slid under his door days ago.  
      No explanation. Just a photo. A building. A name.  
      <strong>Professor S.K. Rana</strong> — retired. Living quietly under government protection.<br><br>

      Ishaan took the night train to Devgarh one last time.
    </p>

    <p>
      The house was old, forgotten — like everything else in this cursed town.<br><br>
      The gate creaked.  
      The windows were dark.  
      But the door... was open.<br><br>

      Ishaan stepped inside.  
      His heart thundered.  
      On the wall: photos of students. Marked with red ink. Scribbled names: <em>“Subject A”</em>, <em>“Catalyst”</em>, <em>“Erased”</em>.<br><br>

      On the table:  
      A mug of tea, still warm.<br><br>

      He followed the corridor.  
      Down into a study lined with steel cabinets and sealed folders.<br><br>

      And then — silence.  
      <em>Not absence of sound — but the kind of silence that waits.</em><br><br>

      Ishaan turned.  
      And there he was.
    </p>

    <p>
      The man was old. Frail. But his eyes…  
      Cold. Calculating. Unmoved.<br><br>

      “You made it,” the man said calmly.  
      “You were always meant to.”<br><br>

      Ishaan raised the knife. His hands trembling.  
      “You erased them. You turned me into a ghost. <span class="bold">Why!?</span>”<br><br>

      The man didn’t flinch.  
      “Because you were never supposed to remember.”<br><br>

      “What do you mean?”  
      “You’re not the victim. You’re the anomaly.”<br><br>

      Ishaan blinked.  
      “What…?”<br><br>

      “We created the Finder to trace narrative threats. You weren’t supposed to *feel*. Just observe. Record. Process.”<br>
      “But you began to love. You interfered. You broke your own rules.”<br><br>

      Ishaan’s mouth went dry.  
      “I was real.”  
      “You were useful.”  
      “They were my friends.”  
      “They were subjects.”<br><br>

      Ishaan dropped the knife.  
      His body shook. Rage, grief, disbelief crashing together.<br><br>

      But when he looked up...  
      The man was gone.<br>
      Only a red smear of blood on the chair.  
      And a wall covered in writing:<br><br>

      <strong>“Truth is a story too.”</strong><br>
      <strong>“Erase the writer, and the ending resets.”</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      Ishaan fell to his knees.<br>
      Alone.  
      Again.<br><br>

      The red moon glowed through the window.  
      The sirens were coming.<br>
      He had escaped the prison — only to enter another.<br><br>

      In the end, he wasn’t the hero.  
      Not the survivor.  
      Not even the finder.  
      <br><br>
      Just the last one left who remembered a story no one was meant to tell.
