      <strong>Knock. Knock.</strong><br><br>
      It was almost gentle. Too gentle.<br><br>
      Ishaan stood frozen, staring at the door. The laptop screen behind him still glowed with that cursed video—<em>FindHer_Final</em>—her eyes screaming through pixels.<br><br>
      Another knock. Then a voice: calm, low, cold.<br><br>
      <em>“We know you remember now.”</em><br><br>
      Ishaan opened the door slowly. A man in a brown coat stood there, clean-shaven, no badge, no name. He held a clipboard as if this were an ordinary visit.<br><br>
      “You’ve been watching,” the man said, stepping inside without permission. “That’s dangerous.”<br><br>
      “Who are you?” Ishaan asked, backing away.<br><br>
      “I’m the reminder. Of what you buried.”<br><br>
      Then everything shattered.

          Ishaan ran under the bleeding sky, feet pounding, heart screaming.  
          The hospital stood like a tomb. Inside, the world smelled sterile... and silent.  
          <br><br>
          “Room 307,” he begged. “Kabir Kapoor.”  
          The nurse blinked. “No such patient.”  
          <br><br>
          Panic. He ran past her.  
          Room 307 was empty. Clean.  
          <br><br>
          On the bed—one item remained. A hand-drawn photo of three boys standing in front of the woods. But only two had faces. The third was scribbled out in red ink.  
          <br><br>
          On the back:  
          <em>“Ishaan, stop digging. Let the dead stay buried.”</em>

          Ishaan slammed the door and turned, fists clenched.  
          “You want something? Say it. Now.”  
          <br><br>
          The man calmly opened his coat. Inside—photos. Ishaan’s own dorm. His laptop. Arjun’s body. Notes in black ink. Psychological terms.  
          <br><br>
          <em>Subject: I. Kapoor. Memory fracture Level IV. Observation in progress.</em>  
          <br><br>
          “This isn’t a story, Ishaan,” the man whispered. “It’s a test.”  
          <br><br>
          Ishaan’s world tilted.  
          “Who are you?”

          Ishaan bolted out into the dark, breath sharp. The street was eerily quiet.  
          No lights. No voices. Just shadows.  
          <br><br>
          He ran to the chapel—empty. The dorm—abandoned.  
          He called everyone. Not a single ringtone.  
          <br><br>
          He reached Professor Malhotra’s house. The windows were shattered. A red moon carved on the wall in blood.  
          <br><br>
          In the center of the room: a ritual circle, burned into the wood.  
          <br><br>
          <em>“They were trying to contain something,”</em> Ishaan whispered.  
          <br><br>
          A journal lay open on the floor, the last page smeared:  
          <em>“When the red moon rises… one will remember. One must not.”</em>
