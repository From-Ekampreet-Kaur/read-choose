      Three choices. Three paths. But only one truth.  
      Ishaan stood at the edge of decision, every breath colder than the last.  
      Somewhere in this madness was the key to it all — Arjun’s scream, Kabir’s silence, and that cursed red moon.

          The police station smelled of cold metal and silence.

          “Why was your name written in blood beside the victim?”  
          “Why were you out at night?”  
          <br>
          He answered every question, but still — the glances exchanged between officers grew heavier.  
          <br><br>
          Then a photograph was tossed onto the table. A blurry image. Kabir and Arjun… arguing.  
          <strong>And Ishaan... watching.</strong>  
          <br><br>
          His stomach dropped. When had this been taken? Who was watching them?

          His bed was made. His shelves untouched. But on his desk… a journal lay open.  
          <br><br>
          Pages were torn out. Some rewritten.  
          There were sketches. A red moon. A shadowy figure. A knife.  
          <br><br>
          On the last page, scribbled in shaky ink:  
          <em>“I don’t know if I can trust either of them. One of them wants me dead.”</em>  
          <br><br>
          Behind a stack of books, Ishaan found a flash drive. Labeled: “Confession?”

          Ishaan stepped over broken branches, into shadows untouched by the sun.

          “Kabir?” he called. Nothing.  
          Then—footsteps.  
          <br>
          A figure emerged. Pale. Bleeding. Kabir.  
          <br><br>
          “They’re watching me,” he whispered.  
          “I didn’t kill him… but I know who did.”  
          Before Ishaan could ask more, Kabir collapsed, a knife wound in his side.  
          Someone had followed him.  
          Someone who didn’t want the truth to live.
